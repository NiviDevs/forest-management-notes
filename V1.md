## 1. Forest: Definitions and Types

**Definitions of Forest**

- **Dictionary:** Large area chiefly with trees/undergrowth; from Latin 'forestis' = outside.
- **Technical:** Area set aside for timber/produce, or maintained under woody vegetation for indirect benefits (climate, protective).
- **Ecological:** Plant community, mostly trees \& woody vegetation, usually closed canopy.
- **Legal:** Area proclaimed forest under forest law.
- **FAO:** All lands with vegetative association influencing climate/water regime/providing livestock \& wildlife shelter.
- **Supreme Court (Godavarman):** ‘Forest’ includes all statutorily recognized forests, regardless of designation.

**Forest Land**

- Includes areas recorded as forest in government records, regardless of ownership.

**Forest Management**

- Integration of silvicultural practices/business concepts to achieve landowner’s objectives.

## 4. Value of Forest

- **Total Economic Value = Use Value + Non-Use Value**
    - **Use Value:**
        - **Direct:** Consumptive (timber, firewood, grazing, NTFP, water); Non-consumptive (recreation, education, research, habitat)
        - **Indirect:** Ecosystem services (watershed, soil/GW, streamflow, N fixation, waste assimilation, C seq, microclimate)
        - **Option:** For future direct/indirect use
    - **Non-Use Value:**
        - **Existence:** Satisfaction of knowing it exists (e.g., polar bear)
        - **Altruistic:** Value from others’ use (e.g., Sunderbans tigers)
        - **Bequest:** Value for future generations

**Valuation Methods**

1. **Market Price:** Value based on market prices of produce (timber, NTFP, etc.)
2. **Hedonic Pricing:** Willingness to pay more for proximity/benefits (less pollution, scenic view)
3. **Travel Cost:** Amount visitors spend to access forest (travel, lodging, entry)
4. **Replacement/Substitute Cost:** Cost to replace forest services (e.g., tsunami wall)
5. **Damage Cost Avoided:** Value of damage prevented by forest
6. **Contingent Valuation:** Expressed willingness to pay (surveys, hypothetical scenarios)

## 5. Silviculture \& Related Concepts

- **Silviculture:** Art/science of cultivating forest crops (‘silva’ = wood, ‘cultura’ = cultivation)
- **Silvics:** Study of life history/adaptation of forest crops (basis for silviculture)
    - **Silviculture = Applied silvics**


### Forest Components (Structure)

- **Abiotic:** Soil, water, air, sunlight
- **Biotic:** Trees, shrubs, grasses, animals, insects, etc.

**Forest Layers:**

- Forest floor (debris, seedlings) → Understorey (shade-adapted) → Canopy (main foliage) → Emergent (towering trees)

**Objectives of Silviculture:**

- Quality timber, high-value species, more timber/area/time, reduce rotation, afforest blank areas, wildlife habitat, aesthetics, exotics, intangible returns

**History of Silviculture:** Three stages

1. Aboriginal: Low pop/technology, little forest impact, some religious conservation
2. Modernizing: Growing pop/tech, increased resource extraction, expansion (Roman/British)
3. Modern: High pop/tech, scarce forests, need for scientific management, e.g., 19thC onward

**Silvicultural Practice:** Treatments to maintain/enhance utility; Planned program (system) to achieve objectives (age structure, occupancy, species mix/distribution, structural attributes [snag trees])

**Linked Forestry Branches:**

- Protection (prevent/control damage: humans, fire, pests)
- Mensuration (quantitative info: diameter, height, volume, age)
- Utilization (harvesting, disposal, use)
- Economics (forests as assets)
- Management (practical/scientific/economic decision-making)

## 6. Plant Growth Factors \& Productivity

- **Growth** = Increase in size/amount/number
- **Photosynthesis:** CO₂ + H₂O → Carbohydrates (using sunlight)
- **Respiration:** Carbohydrates + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O
- **Gross Primary Production (GPP):** Total energy fixed.
- **Net Primary Production (NPP):** GPP - respiration loss.
- **Compensation Point:** Where PS = respiration, occurs morning/evening.
- **Efficiency:** Fixed energy / incident sunlight.
- **NPP = APAR × Light Use Efficiency** (APAR: Absorbed PAR; measurable via satellite/modeling)
- **Productivity Dependent On:** Solar constant (~1388 W/m²), latitude, clouds, dust, water, leaf area/arrangement, CO₂, nutrients

**Nutrients:**

- **Macronutrients:** Needed in large amounts (primary: N, P, K; secondary: Ca, Mg, S), plus C, H, O from air/water
- **Micronutrients (trace):** Fe, Mo, B, Cu, Mn, Na, Zn, Ni, Cl, Co, Al, Si, V, Se
- **Essential Elements:** Criteria:

1. Plant can't complete lifecycle without
2. Deficiency not correctable by another
3. Directly involved in plant metabolism

**Biogeochemical Cycles:** Pathways for movement of substances through biosphere (biotic) and earth systems (abiotic)

- **Cycle:** Plants absorb nutrients → become biomass → eaten by animals → decomposition → nutrients back to pool

## 7. Ecological Succession

- **Succession:** Change in species structure over time (bare rock → lichen → moss → herbs → shrubs → forest)
- **Sere:** Intermediate stage in succession
- **Types:**
    - **Xerosere:** Dry areas (lithosere - rock, psammosere - sand)
    - **Helosere:** Wet/saline (marsh)
- **Pioneer species:** Hardy, tolerant, small, short-lived, prolific dispersal
- **Climax community:** Stable, final stage; types: climatic, edaphic, catastrophic, disclimax (disturbance-maintained)

**Succession Kinds:**

- **Primary:** From bare substrate
- **Secondary:** After disturbance (fire, clearing)
- **Cyclic:** Repeats in cycles

**Phases:**

- Nudation → Migration → Ecesis (establishment) → Aggregation → Competition → Reaction → Stabilization

**Climax Theories:**

- Monoclimax (climate-driven), Poly-climax, Climax pattern (many factors)

## 8. Forest Soils

- **Soil:** Mixture of rock debris \& organic matter supporting plant growth
- **Components:** Mineral particles, humus, water, air
- **Formation:** Weathering (physical, chemical, biological), parent material, relief, climate, life forms, human activity, time
- **Texture:** Proportion of sand, silt, clay; affects porosity, permeability, water holding, erosion
- **Structure:** Arrangement—platy, prismatic, columnar, blocky, granular, wedge, lenticular; affects root growth, water/air flow

**Soil Profile:** O (organic), A (topsoil), B (subsoil), C (substratum), R (bedrock)

## 10. Nutrient Cycles

- **Nitrogen Cycle:**
    - Fixation (Rhizobium/Azotobacter/Nostoc/Anabaena/lightning/Haber’s process) → Ammonification → Nitrification (Nitrosomonas/Nitrococcus/Nitrobacter) → Plant uptake
- **Carbon Cycle:**
    - Atmosphere ↔ ocean ↔ rocks ↔ biosphere (PS, respiration, decomposition, fossil fuel burning)
- **Water Cycle:**
    - Evaporation, transpiration, condensation, rainfall, runoff
- **Phosphorus Cycle:**
    - Rocks → soil phosphates → plants → consumers → back via decay/runoff
- **Sulfur Cycle:**
    - Lithosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, biosphere movement

## 11. Forest Mensuration

**Tree Form:**

- Shape varies by height–diameter:
    - **Top:** Conical (y² = kx²)
    - **Middle:** Paraboloid (y² = kx)
    - **Bottom:** Neiloid (y² = kx³)
- **Taper:** Diameter narrowing per stem length (cm/m)
- **Form factor:** Tree volume / (volume of cylinder based on reference diam.)
    - Absolute (base), false (breast height), true (10% height)
- **Form quotient:** Ratio of diameters at different heights

**Measurement:**

- **Diameter:** At breast height (country-specific)
    - Over/under bark; special rules for forks, slopes
- **Instruments:** Calipers (accurate), tape (overestimates area)

**Height Measurement:**

- **Direct:** Climbing, tapes
- **Indirect:** Similar triangles (shadow, Christen’s), trigonometry (Blume Leiss)
- **Basal area:** π/4 × d²; sum for stand

**Stand Basal Area:** Indicator of crowding; can calculate via spacing factor (avg. spacing between stems/avg. diameter)
