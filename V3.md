## Module 9: Logging, Yield, Growing Stock, Increment, and Sustained Yield

### Logging Process

- **Cruising:** Survey and estimation of volume/grade of timber
- **Tree Marking Colors:**
    - Yellow/Orange: Cut for harvest
    - Blue: Retain (esp. near rivers)
    - Red: Boundary line
    - White: Research plot
    - Black: Correction/over-mistake
- **Registers:**
    - Enumeration Register: Tree characteristics
    - Marking Register: Details of trees to be felled (species, diameter, height, condition)
- **Safety:**
    - Maintain safe distance, 2 escape paths at 45° behind each tree


### Tree Felling Cuts

- **Cuts:**
    - Face Cut = Top cut + Bottom cut (front)
    - Back cut (rear)
    - Holding wood (hinge)
- **Types of Face Cuts:**
    - Conventional (top cut 45°, bottom parallel): Most accurate
    - Humboldt (top parallel, bottom downward): Maximizes timber
    - Open (>70° angle): Greatest hinge control


### Post-Felling Operations

- **Delimbing:** Removing branches (branches left for regeneration/herbivores but often also harvested in India)
- **Bucking:** Cutting logs to size
- **Hammer Marks:** For identification
- **Skidding:** Moving logs to landing (using elephants, tractors, labor)
- **Stacking ("Thappis"):** Logs piled at landing area, register maintained
- **Loading \& Transportation:** Using cranes/forwarders to depot
- **Depot Processing:** Seasoning (moisture reduction), grading (size/condition grouping), painted marking, auction
- **Plywood:** Softwood converted to sheets, glued, pressed


## Growing Stock and Increment

### Definitions

- **Growing Stock:** Volume/biomass of living trees (>X cm DBH) excluding small branches, twigs, roots, etc. (X=10 cm in India)
- **Commercial Growing Stock:** Marketable part of growing stock
- **Factors Affecting Growth:**
    - Natural forests: regeneration, spatial distribution, silviculture, thinning, site/climate
    - Plantations: spacing, treatment, pruning, nutrition, climate


### Logistic Growth Equation

- **Formula:** dy/dt = r × y × (K-y)/K
    - r = intrinsic growth rate
    - K = carrying capacity
    - S-shaped (sigmoidal) curve: lag, log, and stationary phases


### Increment Types

- **Increment:** Increase in diameter, height, volume, etc.
- **Components:**
    - Recruitment: Previously uncounted (now countable) trees
    - Harvest: Volume of harvested trees
    - Mortality: Volume of dead trees
- **Net Growth:** V2-V1+H-I (V=stock, H=harvest, I=recruitment)
- **Gross Growth:** V2-V1+H-I+M (M=mortality)


### Annual Increment Measures

- **Periodic Annual Increment (PAI):** (Stock at t – Stock at t-p) / p
- **Current Annual Increment (CAI):** Increment over 1 year (slope of growth curve)
- **Mean Annual Increment (MAI):** Total stock at t / t
- **CAI max at point of inflection, MAI max where CAI=MAI**


### Factors Affecting Increment

- Species, genetics, physiology, climate, soil (edaphic), biotic factors


### Site Quality

- **Definition:** Relative productivity without management
- **Measured by:**
    - CVP (Patterson) Index: TV×P×G×E / (Ta×12×1000). Growth > 25 = forest growth.
    - Vegetative characteristics: indicator species (e.g., Palash), tree size
    - Crop Height Method: Mean height of largest DBH trees vs. yield table
    - Sample Plot: Diameter-height curves compared to standards


## Yield and Sustained Yield

### Yield

- **Definitions:** Timber harvested per period (usually annual), or total removable at any time.
- **Sustained Yield:** Timber removed annually/periodically without decreasing future yield


### Yield Regulation Methods

- **Area Method:** Area processed/year = Total Area ÷ Rotation period. Even-aged only.
- **Volume Method:** Volume harvested/year = Total Volume ÷ Rotation (ignores increment/site quality).
- **Hundeshagen’s Method:** Harvest ∝ Inventory (H/I = constant)
- **Von Mantel’s Formula:** Annual extraction = 2 × growing stock ÷ Rotation period
- **Austrian Formula:** Extraction = Annual increment + (Excess inventory over normal ÷ P)
- **Cotta’s Formula:** Yield = Stock ÷ Periodic block years + (i/2), i = annual increment
- **Number of Trees:** Compare actual to normal forest curves; extract to restore normalcy
- **Simulation:** Computer models with current data and felling decisions, iteratively refined

## Module 10: Silvicultural Practices

### Seed Collection \& Treatment

- **Good Seeds:** Well-ripened, healthy, pure, viable, uniform, undamaged, pest/disease-free
- **Quantity Calculation:** Required seedlings ÷ Survival factor (germination × picking loss × container loss)
- **Determining Collection Time:**
    - Laboratory: Max dry weight, chemical analysis, X-ray with barium chloride
    - Field: Fruit density, color, embryo examination
- **Selecting Trees:** Dominant/co-dominant, 10–50 trees, spatially separated
- **Collection Methods:** Natural seed fall, shaking, plucking, cutting, animal cache raiding
- **Processing:** Drying (sun/artificial), dewinging, impurity removal, sieving, threshing, grading


### Seed Testing

- **Tests:** Genuineness, purity, viability (cut test, physical test, TTZ chemical staining), germination % \& energy
- **Storage Categories:**
    - Microbiotic (<3 years), Mesobiotic (3–15), Macrobiotic (15–100)
    - Orthodox (tolerate drying, long-term storage), Recalcitrant (high moisture, short-lived)


### Seed Storage Factors

- Initial maturity/condition, age, damage, fungal/insect attack, low oxygen/moisture/temp, darkness


### Seed Banking Principles

- Accession ID, viability/genetic integrity, germplasm health, security, info management


### Seed Certification \& Treatment

- Confirms species/variety/year/origin
- Treatments: Cold/hot/boiling water, wet/dry, acid/mechanical scarification, shell cracking, cow dung

- **Soil Working:** Pitting types (ordinary, saucer, crescent, ring, ridge-ditch, contour trenches, mounds)
- **Planting Periods:** Monsoon (default), pre-monsoon (irrigated), winter/spring (cold/winter rain areas)
- **Process:** Remove cover, place plant with soil, fill (topsoil first), compact (avoid plant)
- **Tending:** Water, weed, fertilize (if needed), replace dead, singling, mulching, data entry

## Module 11: New Trends – NTFP, Social Forestry, Tribal Welfare, Wildlife Conservation

### NTFP (Non-Timber Forest Produce)

- **Definition:** All forest products except timber, firewood, pulpwood. Includes plant/animal/mineral origin (excl./incl. “trees outside forests”)
- **Classifications:** By product (gums, resins, oils, fibers, dyes, medicines), by use (food, medicine, spiritual, construction), by harvested part (leaf, fruit, exudate, animal), by use level (subsistence, commercial)
- **Examples:** Medicinal plants, gums, pine resin (distilled = rosin/turpentine), oils, tannins, dyes, fibers, animal products


### Social Forestry \& Tribal Welfare

- **Definition:** Forestry aiming for protection/recreation/community benefits; emphasizes local people’s involvement/benefits
- **History:**
    - 1865 Forest Act (existing rights), 1878 Forest Act (opposed), 1894 Forest Policy (public benefit), Van Panchayats (1931, Uttarakhand), 1954 Forest Policy (community cooperation needed), 1976 NCA (formally coined term social forestry, expanded definition), 1988 Forest Policy (JFM, people’s movement)
- **Types:** Farm, community, extension, agroforestry
- **Comparisons:**
    - Conventional: Long rotation, by department, single use
    - Social: Short rotation, with society, multiple uses
- **JFM (Joint Forest Management):**
    - Community usufruct rights, microplans with community, linked benefit-sharing, women's participation (e.g., tendu patta), profit-sharing, minor processing, health, education facilitated


### Skills Required

- Communication, NTFP knowledge, motivational, organizational


### Conservation of Wild Animals

- **Conservation:** Sustainable coexistence; differs from preservation/environmentalism/ecology
- **Wildlife Definition (WP Act):** Any animal/vegetation part of habitat
- **IUCN Red List:** Extinct, extinct in wild, critically endangered, endangered, vulnerable, near threatened, least concern, data deficient, not evaluated


### Prioritization

- **Keystone species:** Disproportionately important
- **Umbrella species:** Large habitat needs
- **Flagship species:** Public appeal (e.g., tiger: all three)
- **Extinction Drivers:** Rarity (uncommon habitat, restricted range, low density), HIPPO (Habitat loss, Invasive species, Population, Pollution, Overharvesting)
- **Factors:** Deterministic (large pops), Stochastic (random, small pops)


### Conservation Modes

- **In situ:** On-site (reserves, national parks, protected areas); pros/cons
- **Ex situ:** Zoos, aquaria, captive breeding, botanical gardens, seed banks, cryopreservation; pros/cons
- **Zoo Regulation:** Central Zoo Authority (CZA), master plan approval, stud books, conservation breeding


### Modern Reserve Design

- **Selection:** Species richness, endemism, threat (biodiversity hotspots)
- **Threat Level Target:** Medium (not too low/high)
- **Gap Analysis:** Identify unprotected rich areas
- **Reserve Principles:**
    - Large > Several small
    - Clustered > Linear
    - Circular preferred
    - Maintain connectivity (corridors)
- **Example:** Madhya Pradesh based on Biodiversity Intactness Index and gap analysis; focus on government forest areas, no encroachments
