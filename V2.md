### Surveying Basics

- **Definition:** Measuring positions of natural/man-made features, presented graphically/numerically.
- **Stages:**

1. Reconnaissance (general view)
2. Observation \& Measurement
3. Data Presentation
- **Types of Surveying:**
    - **Plane Surveying:** Assumes Earth is flat (suitable <250 sq km).
    - **Geodetic Surveying:** Considers Earth’s curvature (for large areas).


#### Survey Methods

- **Chain/Tape Survey:** Linear measurements only.
- **Compass Survey:** Measures angles (with a compass) + linear measurements.
- **Plane Table Survey:** Field measurements converted directly to drawings; requires known baseline, measures horizontal \& vertical angles.


#### Measurements

- **Direct:** Using instruments (e.g., tape).
- **Indirect:** Using ratios/proportions (e.g., shadow method).


#### Errors

- **Definition:** Difference between measured and true value.
- **Types:**
    - **Natural:** Environmental variability (temperature, etc.)
    - **Instrumental:** Faulty instruments.
    - **Personal:** Human mistakes.
- **Precision vs. Accuracy:**
    - **Precision:** Closeness of repeated measurements.
    - **Accuracy:** Closeness to the true value.
- **Bias:** Systematic error (can be corrected by calibration).

### Sampling in Forest Surveying

- **Census:** Measure all units.
- **Sampling:** Measure a subset to represent the whole.
- **Population:** Aggregate from which the sample is drawn.
- **Sampling Unit:** Subdivision (can be admin/natural/artificial).
- **Frame:** List of all sampling units.
- **Sample:** Chosen units from the frame.
- **Sampling Intensity:** (Sample units/Total units) × 100.


#### Plot Types

- Circular, rectangular, strips, topographic.


#### Sampling Methods

- **Simple Random Sampling:** Equal chance for all units (e.g., lottery).
- **Systematic Sampling:** Every kth unit, starting from a random point.
- **Stratified Sampling:** Population split into homogeneous strata; samples taken from each.
- **Multistage Sampling:** Large units sampled first, then their sub-units.
- **PPS (Probability Proportional to Size):** Larger units more likely to be sampled if size correlates with variable of interest.

### Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing

- **Photogrammetry:** Science/tech of obtaining spatial measurements from photos.
    - Principle: Triangulation for 3D perception (using parallax from multiple images).
- **Remote Sensing:** Obtaining information without physical contact.


#### Platforms

- **Ground-borne:** Horizontal cameras.
- **Air-borne:** Drones/aircraft; variable camera angles.
- **Space-borne:** Satellites; vertical cameras.


#### Steps

- Use software/mathematical methods to get 3D coordinates.


#### Applications

- Surveying, 3D mapping, change detection (e.g., land use, building presence).


#### Image Resolutions

- **Spatial:** Pixel ground size (more pixels = higher resolution).
- **Temporal:** Frequency of data capture.
- **Spectral:** Number of bands (e.g., B\&W = 1, RGB = 3, multispectral).
- **Radiometric:** Number of distinguishable intensity levels.


#### Photography Parameters

- **Field of View:** Depends on focal length, camera angle.
- **Focus (Depth of Field):** Controlled by f-number (higher f = greater depth).
- **Exposure:** Controlled by shutter speed, ISO, f-number.
- **Orientation:** True vertical (rare), near vertical, oblique (high/low, depending on horizon visibility).


#### Image Overlap \& Corrections

- Overlap is crucial for stereo viewing.
- Altitude variation affects scale; keep altitude constant/recorded.
- Corrections for tilt, atmospheric, edge distortion, and parallax.


#### Cameras

- **Metric Cameras:** Stable geometry, low distortion, known focal length, defined by fiducial marks.
- **Stereometric Cameras:** Two metric cameras for stereo imagery.

### Forest Protection

#### Types of Threats

- **Natural:** Frost, wind, insects, pests, diseases, animals, invasive species, climate change, fires.
- **Anthropogenic:** Illegal activities (felling, mining, grazing), encroachment, poaching, pollution, invasive species, climate change, fires.


#### Human Impact Equation

- I = P × A × T (Impact = Population × Affluence × Technology)


#### Species Loss Estimation: Island Biogeography

- S = C × A^z (S = species richness, A = area, C/z = constants)
- z typically 0.15–0.35
- Large area loss → significant species loss (even 90% area loss retains ~50% species).


#### Extinction Factors

- **HIPPO:**
    - H: Habitat loss
    - I: Invasive species
    - P: Pollution
    - P: Population (human)
    - O: Overharvesting
- **Reasons for Rarity:** Restricted habitat/type, small range, low population density.
- **Extinction Factors:**
    - **Deterministic:** Affect large populations (birth/death rates, population structure).
    - **Stochastic:** Affect small populations (demographic/environmental variations, catastrophes, genetics).


#### Sensitivity to Human Impacts

- Species' adaptability/resilience, human attention/charisma, ecological overlap with humans, home range size (large = more susceptible).

### Silvicultural Management

#### Regeneration

- **Definition:** Renewing tree cover by establishing young trees post-harvest.
- **Types:**

1. **Natural Regeneration (NR):** By natural seeding/vegetative means (needs seed trees, minimal site disturbance).
2. **Artificial Regeneration (AR):** Direct sowing/planting.
3. **Assisted Natural Regeneration (ANR):** Enhancing natural regeneration by removing barriers (weeds, fire, grazing), ring weeding, grass suppression, protection, possible enrichment planting.


#### Methods

- **Direct Seeding:** Broadcasting, dibbling, line/strip/patch sowing.
- **Planting:** Bare root/containerized seedlings, vegetative propagation.
    - **Steps:** Species/stock selection, site prep, spacing, pit digging, planting.


##### Pros/Cons

- **Natural Regeneration:** Low cost, genetically adapted, variable genetic diversity; needs viable seed crop, risk from dry soil, pests, slow.
- **Assisted NR:** Simple, effective, inexpensive, job opportunities; needs skilled labor, detailed training, community participation, may clash with agri. calendar.
- **Artificial Regeneration:** Control over density, yield, species; cost/labor intensive, less adapted, more site disturbance.


#### Silvicultural Systems

- **Definition:** Planned sequence of treatments for stand objectives (age structure, species mix, spatial arrangement).
- **Stand:** Contiguous tree community, uniform enough to distinguish from others (even-aged, uneven-aged, two-aged).
- **Rotation:** Planned years between establishment \& final felling.


##### Main Systems

- **Clear Felling:** All trees in area felled at once, even-aged regeneration (suitable for light-demanding species); risk of denudation, not for shade bearers.
- **Shelterwood:** Successive cuttings, old trees provide shelter for regeneration (suitable for shade-tolerant/moisture-loving species).
    - **Stages:** Preparatory, seeding, secondary, final felling.
- **Group System:** Regeneration in groups, areas enlarged centrifugally (uses advance growth, gives protection, but complex/difficult to manage).
- **Selection System:** Continuous felling/regeneration, uneven-aged crop, selection diameter replaces rotation age, complex, more natural forest.
- **Irregular Shelterwood:** Maintains irregular stands, combines shelterwood \& selection systems, intensive/costly, favors shade bearers.


#### Objectives

- Meet working plan goals, predictable harvest, balance bio/economic/ecological concerns, ensure regeneration, sustain ecosystem services.

### Important Terms \& Concepts

- **Coupe:** Area worked/felled each year in rotation.
- **Periodic Block:** Part of forest set aside for regeneration during a specific period (number of blocks = rotation age/regeneration period).
- **Tending:** Operations (cleaning, thinning, pruning, etc.) for crop benefit at any life stage.
- **Felling Cycle:** Interval between main fellings in selection system.
- **Inverse J Curve:** Desired stand structure (few large trees, many small).
